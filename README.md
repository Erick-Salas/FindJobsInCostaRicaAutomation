The report contains the name of the job found, the name of the company and the URL of the page where the job was found.

# Important Notes:
- These automations need the Google Chrome web browser to be able to run, it must be installed in your computer.
- The chromedriver.exe file must be updated accordingly to the version of your Chrome browser. You can download the chromedriver.exe from this website: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/. To know what version you need to download you can open your Chrome browser, go to Help > About Google Chrome. Once the chromedriver.exe is downloaded you need to placed it in the following project path: FindJobsInCostaRicaAutomation > web_driver > chrome_driver.  
- To be able to run all the automations effectively you should close all Google Chrome windows before running the automations.
- The Costa Rica jobsites used for these automations are:
  - https://acciontrabajo.co.cr/
  - https://www.buscojobs.cr/
  - https://www.elempleo.com/cr/cross
  - https://cr.indeed.com/
  - https://cr.jooble.org/
  - https://www.opcionempleo.co.cr/
  - https://www.tecoloco.co.cr/
  - https://www.linkedin.com/feed/
- To run the LinkedIn automation effectively you must first login with your account after running the automation. When the automation opens the website link, it must enter your LinkedIn session.
- The automations can fail if the user interface of the websites were modified, normally for UI automations is necessary maintenance of the automation scripts when this happens.
- If the automations fail can be because the chromedriver.exe is not updated or because the websites were modified.
